        Sustainability: Aluminum’s Eco-Friendly Advantages
        </h2>
        <p className={styles.para}>
        Aluminum stands out as an environmentally responsible material with several key features:
        <ol>
          <li>Infinitely Recyclable: Aluminum is one of the most recycled—and recyclable—materials in use today. A recycled aluminum beverage can, car door or window frame can often be recycled directly back into itself. This process can happen virtually infinitely, making it a circular economy solution.</li>
          <li>Energy Efficiency: Making recycled aluminum requires only around 5% of the energy needed to produce new aluminum. This significantly reduces carbon emissions and saves money for businesses and consumers. Nearly 75% of all aluminum ever produced is still in use today.</li>
          <li>High Recycling Rates: In many industrial markets like automotive and building, recycling rates for aluminum exceed 90%. Industry efforts in the U.S. save more than 90 million barrels of oil equivalent annually.</li>
          <li>Growing Secondary Production: Over 80% of U.S. aluminum production today comes from recycled (or secondary) aluminum. Increasing aluminum recycling translates to less energy use and a lower carbon impact.</li>
          </ol> 
        </p>
        <p className={styles.para}>
        Aluminum’s “infinitely recyclable” nature makes it a sustainable choice for a greener future!
        </p>
